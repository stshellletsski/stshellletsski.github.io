### Why this game?
Simon Game is a Front-end web dev course project. Course I have started through IBM skillsbuild platform in Sep/Oct '23, and it utilises Udemy's Front-end web dev bootcamp created by Angela Yu from https://github.com/appbrewery.
You can check the design I based my Simon Game on, here: https://londonappbrewery.github.io/Simon-Game/.

### Tech stack choices
HTML5, CSS, JS.
Although I already touched frameworks such as bootstrap and jQuery, I have decided to first see what is possible with pure front-end trinity. After all, if you can build a beautiful house with nothing but saw, hammer and chowing gum, you must be skilful enough to build a rocket - given enough time and sophisticated tools.

### How did you code it?
I started with simple enough html structure, that I had to modify later to accommodate for my css choices, mainly usage of grid for tiles. This particular grid setup renders as 1 x 4, 2 x 2 or 4 x 1, depending on vw of the device. I have decided not to use media query in this project. Tiles and font-size are scaling with vw of the device and should work well with majority of the screens.
Given the fact that I have not used any of the course materials related to this project, other than playing the example provided to understand what was expected, I believe I did a pretty good job regarding structure and styling.

In regards of functionality, It was a frustrating but rewarding process. I, on occasions, worked on logic for specific functionality for hour, writing code
and debugging for another hour, just to realise certain functionality can not be easily implemented the way I wanted, due to limitation of my skill, knowledge and tools I decided to use. JavaScript is not a perfect language by any mean, and from a perspective of aspiring software engineer, trying to learn both language and  best logic implementation practices of plethora of features is *NOT RECOMMENDED*

### What did you learn?
HTML - not much here. Still struggling with correct understanding of semantic html. But I have a footer!

CSS - I wanted to practice grid the most as I previously used only flex box model in my projects. I have learned that grid is capable of creating advanced layouts with minimal structural investment of containers, but lacks flex-ibility. I practised gradients animation and I am especially proud of my glowing words.
I have invested a good few hours on CSS.

JavaScript - I always claimed to be better at functionality than visual design. This project was a challenge. 

!WIP!

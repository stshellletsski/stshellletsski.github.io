## My process

- Visiualise design as collection of containers holding content
- Structure design with HTML
- Size the containers to match the design
- Style backgrounds, borders, etc. to match the design
- Add content
- Style fonts
- Adjust padding, margin and font size to match the design

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

As this is my first front-end project in 19 years, I had to learn everything from scratch.  
Biggest and most important lesson taken from the project:   
- Visualise the whole design and brake it down into sub-components.
- CSS is difficult to master and debug.
